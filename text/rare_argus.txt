For players that, like me, plan to farm the mounts and other collectibles daily, I have compiled a set of macros with the tom-tom waypoints for rares that drop mounts. I used previous comments by others, especially Boxofbeer, as well as Wowhead maps to compile the coordinates.

/way Mac'aree 55.7 59.9 Wrangler Kravos
/way Antoran wastes 61.7 37.2 Blistermaw
/way Antoran wastes 63.1 25.2 Entrance: Houndmaster Kerrax
/way Antoran wastes 65.5 26.7 Puscilla
/way Mac'aree 49.7 9.9 Skreeg the Devourer
/way Mac'aree 33.7 47.5 Venomtail Skyfin

For the rares that drop eggs which may hatch into mounts, companions, or junk:

/way Antoran wastes 64.3 48.2 Varga
/way Krokuun 70.5 33.7 Naroua
/way Mac'aree 44.2 49.8 Sabuul

For rares that drop companion pets:

/way Antoran wastes 65.5 26.6 Mother Rosula Entrance
/way Antoran wastes 50.4 56.1 Urzul Bone
/way Antoran wastes 65.6 26.3 Imp Bone
/way Antoran wastes 52.4 35.3 Fiend Bone

/way Antoran Wastes 58.6 12 Doomcaster Suprax
/way Mac'aree 61.4 50.2 Instructor Tarahna (3 colors)

/way Krokuun 52.8 31 Sister Subversia

Note that not all rares seem to spawn each day.
